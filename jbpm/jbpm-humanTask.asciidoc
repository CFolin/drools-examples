Warming up
----------

* Many end-to-end business processes require human interactions with the process. For example, humans may be needed for approvals, exception management, or performing activities required to advance the business process.
* jBPM5 exploring the Human Task  which is based on the `WS-HumanTask specification`
* jBPM supports a special human task node inside processes for modeling this interaction with human users.

In order to use human tasks inside your processes you need three components:

* A Human task node
* A Human Task Server 
* A Human Task Client

To be precise, a Task Server where task are registered and a Task Client which is used to interact with tasks. task Server also can be treat as task management component
