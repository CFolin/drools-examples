The simples process
First process is illustrating how you move around in KIE workbench web application. Where to:

    create repository
    create project
    configure Knowledge Base, KnowledgeSession
    create process
    build and deploy
    execute process and work with user task


Custom data and forms
Next let's explore more and start with bit advanced features like:

    building custom data model that will be used as process variable
    make use of process variables in user task
    define custom forms for process and tasks
    edit and adjust your process and task forms


Make use of business rules and decisions in your process
At the end let's make the process be more efficient by applying business rules in the process and then use gateways as deception points. This example introduces:

    use of business rule task
    define business rules with Drools
    use XOR gateway to split between different paths in the process

Important to note that business rule task can automatically insert and retract process variables using data input and output of business rule task. When defining them make sure that both data input and output are named exactly the same to allow engine to properly retract the facts on business rule task completion.

That would be all for the first steps with jBPM 6. Stay tuned for more examples and videos!

As usual comments more than welcome.
