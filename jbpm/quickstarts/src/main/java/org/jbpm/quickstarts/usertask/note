<tkobayas> pasting the my last comments
<tkobayas> <tkobayas> in community jbpm, a Human Task Service is based on Mina which listens to 9123 by default.
<tkobayas> <tkobayas> on the other hand, BRMS 5.3.0, a HumanTaskService is based on HornetQ which listens to 5446. 
<tkobayas> <tkobayas> In BRMS 5.3.1, a HumanTaskService is based on HornetQ which listens to 5153. 
<kylin_> yes, the networking is down just now
<tkobayas> if you want to connect to BRMS 5.3.1 HumanTaskService, please follow the kcs

<kylin_> okay, I will try to run a User Task process first
<tkobayas> Also if you create a sample project in JBDS, ProcessMain launches a convenient Mina Human Task Service by JBPMHelper.
